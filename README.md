# Real-Time Agent Client

A real-time agent client built with Next.js, TypeScript, Zustand, and WebSockets. The application separates WebSocket transport, sequence-based ordering and deduplication, protocol event processing, and UI state management to provide incremental streaming while handling tool calls, context updates, out-of-order messages, duplicates, and connection failures.

The client uses a `SequenceBuffer` to order incoming messages by `seq`, an `EventProcessor` to convert protocol messages into application-level events, and Zustand to maintain chat messages, tool state, context, and the trace timeline.

## WebSocket State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Connecting

    Connecting --> Connected: WebSocket opened
    Connected --> Streaming: User message sent

    Streaming --> Streaming: TOKEN
    Streaming --> ToolCallPending: TOOL_CALL
    ToolCallPending --> Streaming: TOOL_RESULT

    Streaming --> Completed: Valid STREAM_END
    Completed --> Connected: Stream cleaned up

    Streaming --> Reconnecting: Connection lost
    ToolCallPending --> Reconnecting: Connection lost
    Connected --> Reconnecting: Connection lost

    Reconnecting --> Resuming: Connection restored
    Resuming --> Streaming: Recovery succeeds
    Resuming --> Restarting: Stream cannot be recovered
    Restarting --> Streaming: Request restarted

    Reconnecting --> Reconnecting: Reconnect attempt fails
```

## Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saieshwar69/agent-server.git
cd agent-server
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Agent Server

Run the provided assignment agent-server locally. The client expects the WebSocket agent server to be available at:

```text
ws://localhost:4747/ws
```
Link for the container : https://github.com/Alchemyst-ai/hiring/tree/main/June-2026_FullStackAI%2Fagent-server
```bash
download the folder agent-server 
cd agent-server 
docker compose up --build
```

Make sure the agent-server is running before starting the client.

### 4. Build the Next.js application

```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Start the production application

```bash
npm run start
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

For development mode, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```
